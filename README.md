# ScientificComputing

This is the Coursework File of the Second Year Scientific Computing Module.

Module learning outcomes
By the end of the course, a successful student should be able to: understand and apply numerical methods for the solution of simple physical and mathematical problems.

Use a high-level programming language (Python) to write clear and structured scripts and functions to implement algorithms.

Have gathered sufficient knowledge of different career paths for physics graduates that they can draw up their own plan to achieve employment success after graduation.

Module Outline
Revision of representation of numbers and basics of Python programming
Application of numerical methods to model simple physical problems, involving:
-Solution of algebraic equations
-Interpolation
-Numerical integration and differentiation
-Numerical solution of ordinary differential equations
-Numerical solution of linear systems of equations
-Visualisation of data

ASSIGNMENTS ARE INDIVIDUAL TASKS AND NOT GROUP ACTIVITIES.
(UNLESS EXPLICITLY INDICATED AS GROUP ACTIVITIES)
Copying of text from other learners or from other sources is not allowed
It is not acceptable to retype existing text and just acknowledge the
source in a footnote – you should be able to relate the idea or concept, without
repeating the original author to the letter.
The aim of the assignments is not the reproduction of existing material, but to
ascertain whether you have the ability to integrate existing texts, add your own
interpretation and/or critique of the texts and offer a creative solution to existing
problems.

Be warned: students who submit copied text will obtain a mark of zero for the
assignment and disciplinary steps may be taken by the Faculty and/or
University. It is also unacceptable to do somebody else’s work, to lend your
work to them or to make your work available to them to copy – be careful and
do not make your work available to anyone!
