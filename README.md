ASSIGNMENTS ARE INDIVIDUAL TASKS AND NOT GROUP ACTIVITIES.
(UNLESS EXPLICITLY INDICATED AS GROUP ACTIVITIES)
Copying of text from other learners or from other sources is not allowed
It is not acceptable to retype existing text and just acknowledge the
source in a footnote – you should be able to relate the idea or concept, without
repeating the original author to the letter.
The aim of the assignments is not the reproduction of existing material, but to
ascertain whether you have the ability to integrate existing texts, add your own
interpretation and/or critique of the texts and offer a creative solution to existing
problems.

Be warned: students who submit copied text will obtain a mark of zero for the
assignment and disciplinary steps may be taken by the Faculty and/or
University. It is also unacceptable to do somebody else’s work, to lend your
work to them or to make your work available to them to copy – be careful and
do not make your work available to anyone!
